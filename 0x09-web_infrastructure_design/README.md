## Project Tasks

Each task file contains a link to an image hosted on Imgur and/or an explanatory file (.md) as part of the project requirements described below: <br />

### [0-simple_web_stack](0-simple_web_stack)

Design a one server web infrastructure that hosts the website that is reachable via `www.foobar.com.` Start your explanation by having a user wanting to access your website. <br />

You must use:

* 1 physical server

* 1 web server (Nginx)

* 1 application server

* 1 application files (your code base)

* 1 database (MySQL)

* 1 domain name `foobar.com` configured with a `www` record that points to your server IP `8.8.8.8`

### [1-distributed_web_infrastructure](1-distributed_web_infrastructure)

Design a three-server web infrastructure that host the website `www.foobar.com`. <br />

You must add to [0-simple_web_stack](0-simple_web_stack):

* 2 physical servers

* 1 web server (Nginx)

* 1 application server

* 1 load-balancer (HAproxy)

* 1 application files (your code base)

* 1 database (MySQL)

### [2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure](2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure)

Design a three-server web infrastructure that host the website `www.foobar.com`, it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic and be monitored. <br />

You must add to [1-distributed_web_infrastructure](1-distributed_web_infrastructure):

* 3 firewalls

* 1 SSL certificate to serve `www.foobar.com` over HTTPS

* 3 monitoring clients (data collector for Sumologic or other monitoring services)

### [3-scale_up](3-scale_up)

You must add to [2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure](2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure):

* 1 physical server

* 1 load-balancer (HAproxy) configured as cluster with the other one

* Split components (web server, application server, database) with their own server

| [`1-distributed_web_infrastructure`](./1-distributed_web_infrastructure) | Web Infrastructure Design, based on `0-simple_web_stack` that contains some additional components: 1 server, 1 web server, 1 application server, 1 load-balancer, 1 set of application files, 1 database |
| [`2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure`](2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure) | Web Infrastructure Design, based on `1-distributed_web_infrastructure` that contains some additional components: 3 firewalls, 1 SSL certificate, 3 monitoring clients |
| [`3-scale_up`](3-scale_up) | Web Infrastructure Design, based on `2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure` that contains some additional components: 1 server, 1 load-balancer |

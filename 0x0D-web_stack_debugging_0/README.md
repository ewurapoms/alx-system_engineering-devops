**This project introduces learners to web stack debugging. Here, broken/bugged webstacks were given for learners to provide a Bash script that once executed, will bring the webstack to a working state.**

## Task :page_with_curl:

* **0. Give me a page!**
  * [0-give_me_a_page](./0-give_me_a_page): Bash script that runs Apache on a
  web server and gets it to respond to queries to the root.
